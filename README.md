## Shortest-Path-on-Road-Network


#### First implement the CH method on a road network of city of Oldenburg. Able to compute the shortest distance between two nodes and also retrieve the nodes we pass.

#### Folder 'ShortestPath' is the implementation for CH algorithm;<br/> Folder 'shortpath' is the implementation for algorith SILC;<br/> Folder 'ShortestPath_version2' is the update for SILC algorithm.
#### OL and medium is the dataset we currently testing.
